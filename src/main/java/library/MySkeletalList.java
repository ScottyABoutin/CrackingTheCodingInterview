/**
 * This class provides a skeletal implementation of the {@link java.util.List} interface to minimize
 * the effort required to implement this interface backed by a "random access" data store (such as
 * an array). For sequential access data (such as a linked list), {@link MySkeletalSequentialList}
 * should be used in preference to this class.
 * <p>
 * To implement an unmodifiable list, the programmer needs only to extend this class and provide
 * implementations for the {@link #get(int)} and {@link #size()} methods.
 * <p>
 * To implement a modifiable list, the programmer must additionally override the
 * {@link #set(int, Object)} method (which otherwise throws an
 * {@code UnsupportedOperationException}). If the list is variable-size the programmer must
 * additionally override the {@link #add(int, Object)} and {@link #remove(int)} methods.
 * <p>
 * The programmer should generally provide a void (no argument) and collection constructor, as per
 * the recommendation in the {@link java.util.Collection} interface specification.
 * <p>
 * Unlike the other abstract collection implementations, the programmer does <em>not</em> have to
 * provide an iterator implementation; the iterator and list iterator are implemented by this class,
 * on top of the "random access" methods: {@link #get(int)}, {@link #set(int, Object)},
 * {@link #add(int, Object)} and {@link #remove(int)}.
 * <p>
 * The documentation for each non-abstract method in this class describes its implementation in
 * detail. Each of these methods may be overridden if the collection being implemented admits a more
 * efficient implementation.
 *
 * @param E the type of elements in this list

     * The number of times this list has been <em>structurally modified</em>. Structural
     * modifications are those that change the size of the list, or otherwise perturb it in such a
     * fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results.
     * <p>
     * This field is used by the iterator and list iterator implementation returned by the
     * {@code iterator} and {@code listIterator} methods. If the value of this field changes
     * unexpectedly, the iterator (or list iterator) will throw a
     * {@code ConcurrentModificationException} in response to the {@code next}, {@code remove},
     * {@code previous}, {@code set}, or {@code add} operations. This provides <em>fail-fast</em>
     * behavior, rather than non-deterministic behavior in the face of concurrent modification
     * during iteration.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Use of this field by subclasses is optional.</strong> If a subclass wishes to provide
     * fail-fast iterators (and list iterators), then it merely has to increment this field in its
     * {@code add(int, E)} and {@code remove(int)} methods (and any other methods that it overrides
     * that result in structural modifications to the list). A single call to {@code add(int, E)} or
     * {@code remove(int)} must add no more than one to this field, or the iterators (and list
     * iterators) will throw bogus {@code ConcurrentModificationException}s. If an implementation
     * does not wish to provide fail-fast iterators, this field may be ignored.

     * This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations (of the sort that commonly

     * passing a subList view instead of a whole list. For example, the following idiom removes a

     * 
     * <pre>
     *     {@code list.subList(from, to).clear();}

     * Similar idioms may be constructed for {@code indexOf} and {@code lastIndexOf}, and all of the
     * algorithms in the {@code Collections} class can be applied to a subList.
     * <p>
     * The semantics of the list returned by this method become undefined if the backing list (i.e.,
     * this list) is <em>structurally modified</em> in any way other than via the returned list.
     * (Structural modifications are those that change the size of this list, or otherwise perturb
     * it in such a fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results.)
     * 
     * @implSpec This implementation returns a list that subclasses {@code MySkeletalList}. The
     * subclass stores, in private fields, the size of the subList (which can change over its
     * lifetime), and the expected {@code modCount} value of the backing list. There are two
     * variants of the subclass, one of which implements {@code RandomAccess}. If this list
     * implements {@code RandomAccess} the returned list will be an instance of the subclass that
     * implements {@code RandomAccess}.
     * <p>
     * The subclass's {@code set(int, E)}, {@code get(int)}, {@code add(int, E)},

     * methods on the backing abstract list, after bounds-checking the index and adjusting for the
     * offset. The {@code addAll(Collection<?> c)} method merely returns {@code addAll(size, c)}.
     * <p>
     * The {@code listIterator(int)} method returns a "wrapper object" over a list iterator on the
     * backing list, which is created with the corresponding method on the backing list. The
     * {@code iterator} method merely returns {@code listIterator()}, and the {@code size} method
     * merely returns the subclass's {@code size} field.

    /**
     * This {@code Spliterator} is an object for traversing and partitioning elements of a
     * {@code MySkeletalList} that is also {@code RandomAccess}. It may traverse elements
     * individually ({@link #tryAdvance(Consumer)}) or sequentially in bulk
     * ({@link #forEachRemaining(Consumer)}). It traverses elements via {@link List#get(int)} rather
     * than an iterator due to a {@code RandomAccess} list not needing an {@code Iterator} to get
     * the next element to achieve {@code O(1)} access time.
     * <p>
     * This may also partition off some of its elements (using {@link #trySplit()}) as another
     * Spliterator, to be used in possibly-parallel operations. This uses an index-based
     * split-by-two algorithm to split off child {@code Spliterator}s.
     * <p>
     * This {@code Spliterator} has the characteristics of {@code ORDERED}, {@code SIZED}, and
     * {@code SUBSIZED}. {@code ORDERED} indicates that the elements are traversed in ascending
     * index order on {@link #forEachRemaining(Consumer)}, that the next element by index is
     * traversed on {@link #tryAdvance(Consumer)}, and that {@link #trySplit()} splits a strict
     * prefix of elements. {@code SIZED} indicates that the value returned from
     * {@link #estimateSize()} (and, subsequently, {@link #getExactSizeIfKnown()}) returns a finite
     * size that, in absence of structural source modification, represents the exact count of
     * elements that would be encountered b a complete traversal. {@code SUBSIZED} indicates that
     * any child {@code Spliterator} created from {@link #trySplit()} will also report {@code SIZED}
     * (and therefore, {@code SUBSIZED}).
     * <p>
     * This spliterator is <em>late-binding</em>, meaning that it binds to the source of elements at
     * the point of first traversal, first split, or first query for estimated size, rather than at
     * the time the Spliterator is created. If access results in an
     * {@code IndexOutOfBoundsException} then a {@code ConcurrentModificationException} is thrown
     * instead (since the list has been structurally modified while traversing). This will also
     * attempt to detect structural modification by using the {@code modCount} field from the list
     * to fail fast if that list is an instance of a {@code MySkeletalList}. This adheres to the
     * best-effort structural modification that can be detected on a {@code Spliterator} that is

/**
 * This class provides a skeletal implementation of the {@code Collection} interface, to minimize
 * the effort required to implement this interface.
 * <p>
 * To implement an unmodifiable collection, the programmer needs only to extend this class and
 * provide implementations for the {@code iterator} and {@code size} methods.
 * <p>
 * To implement a modifiable collection, the programmer must additionally override this class's
 * {@code add} method (which otherwise throws an {@code UnsupportedOperationException}), and the
 * iterator returned by the {@code iterator} method must additionally implement its {@code remove}
 * method (which otherwise throws an {@code UnsupportedOperationException}).
 * <p>
 * The programmer should generally provide a no argument and {@code Collection} constructor, as per
 * the recommendation in the {@code Collection} interface specification.
 * <p>
 * The documentation for each non-abstract method in this class describes its implementation in
 * detail. Each of these methods may be overridden if the collection being implemented admits a more
 * efficient implementation.

     * Creates a {@link Spliterator} over the elements in this collection. Implementations should
     * document characteristic values reported by the spliterator. Such characteristic values are
     * not required to be reported if the spliterator reports {@link Spliterator#SIZED} and this
     * collection contains no elements.
     * <p>
     * The default implementation should be overridden by subclasses that can return a more
     * efficient spliterator. In order to preserve expected laziness behavior for the
     * {@link #stream()} and {@link #parallelStream()} methods, spliterators should either have the
     * characteristic of IMMUTABLE or CONCURRENT, or be <em>late-binding</em>. If none of these is
     * practical, the overriding class should describe the spliterator's documented policy of
     * binding and structural interference, and should override the {@link #stream()} and
     * {@link #parallelStream()} methods to create streams using a {@code Supplier} of the
     * spliterator, as in:
     * 
     * <pre>
     * {@code
     *     Stream<E> s = StreamSupport.stream(() -> spliterator(), spliteratorCharacteristics)
     * }
     * </pre>
     * 
     * These requirements ensure that streams produced by the {@link #stream()} and
     * {@link #parallelStream()} methods will reflect the contents of the collection as of
     * initiation of the terminal stream operation.
     * 
     * @implSpec The default implementation creates a <em>late-binding</em> spliterator from the
     * collection's {@code Iterator}. The spliterator inherits the <em>fail-fast</em> properties of
     * the collection's iterator.
     * <p>
     * The created {@code Spliterator} reports {@link java.util.Spliterator#SIZED}.
     * @implNote The created {@code Spliterator} additionally reports
     * {@link java.util.Spliterator#SUBSIZED}.
     * <p>
     * If a spliterator covers no elements then the reporting of additional characteristic values,
     * beyond that of SIZED and SUBSIZED, does not aid clients to control, specialize or simplify
     * computation. However, this does enable shared use of an immutable and empty spliterator
     * instance (see {@link java.util.Spliterators#emptySpliterator()}) for empty collections, and
     * enables clients to determine if such a spliterator covers no elements.
